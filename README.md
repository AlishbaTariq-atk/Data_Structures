# Data Structures

Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository! Dive into my journey of mastering data structures using C++. This repository showcases my code, reflecting my learning and growth in understanding various data structures.

## Introduction

Data structures are the backbone of efficient software development. They enable you to manage and organize data effectively, leading to optimized and scalable code. Mastering data structures is crucial for solving complex problems, acing technical interviews, and building robust applications.

  ## -> Grid_Game
  *Description:* <br> This code implements a simple grid-based game where the player starts in the middle of a 3x3 grid, marked by 'O'. The player can move up, down, left, or right and encounters rewards ('-') or collision objects ('X') based on random placement. The game checks for outcomes based on the player's chosen move and displays the grid with results.

 # 4. List 
   ## -> Character_List (Dynamic Array Implementation)
   *Description:* <br> This code implements a dynamic array-based list (list class) that allows insertion, removal, searching, and printing of characters. The main function uses this list to simulate a game where the goal is to transform a randomly generated character combination into the word "fariba" using the minimum number of insertions or removals.

   ## -> Even-Odd List
  *Description:* <br> A list that rearranges integers such that even numbers occupy odd-indexed positions and odd numbers occupy even-indexed positions.

<br>


 # 5. Linked List (Singly , Doubly, Circular)
   ## -> Playlist_Manager
   *Description:* <br> This program implements a playlist manager using a linked list (list class), allowing users to add, delete, update, search, print, and play songs. Users can specify the position of the song to add, delete, or update, making it flexible for managing song preferences within the playlist.

   ## -> Task_List
   *Description:* <br> A doubly linked list implementation for managing tasks with operations to add, mark as complete, remove completed tasks, and display tasks in both forward and reverse order.  

   ## -> Circular_Playlist
  *Description:* <br> A circular linked list implementation for managing playlists, allowing operations to add, remove, update, search, print, and play songs in a circular sequence.

  ## -> k-Alternate Node Reversal
   *Description:* <br> Reverses every alternate group of k nodes in a singly linked list.

  ## -> Josephus Problem Solver 
  *Description:* <br> This C++ program solves the Josephus problem using a circular linked list, where every m-th person is eliminated until only one person remains. It allows insertion, deletion, and display operations on the circular list and computes the position of the last survivor.

 ## -> Books_Manager
  *Description:* <br> A management system for a book library implemented using a doubly linked list, facilitating operations such as book insertion, deletion, search by ISBN or title, and filters by author or genre.

# 6. Stack
 ## -> StringStack
  *Description:* <br> A stack implementation using an array of strings, supporting operations such as push, pop, peek, and display. This stack specifically manages strings, demonstrating basic stack functionalities for handling string data.

 ## -> Stack
 *Description:* <br> A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top. This implementation uses a dynamic array to store characters, providing operations like push, pop, peek, and display. The program demonstrates reversing a string using a stack.

 ## -> Undo-Redo Stack
  *Description:* <br> This implementation uses a stack data structure to simulate an undo-redo functionality for a string input. It provides operations like push (undo), pop (redo), and display to manage the string operations effectively. The program allows users to input a string and perform undo and redo operations interactively.

 ## -> Palindrome_Checker
  *Description:* <br> Implements a linked list and stack to check if a sequence of characters entered by the user forms a palindrome.

 ## -> Bracket_Checker
  *Description:* <br> Checks if brackets in a given expression are properly matched and nested using a stack-based approach. It verifies pairs of brackets ((), [], {}) to ensure every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

 ## -> Postfix Expression Evaluator
   *Description:* <br> Evaluates a postfix expression using a stack-based approach. The program reads a postfix expression where each operand and operator is separated by a space. It supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^) and correctly evaluates multi-digit operands.

 ## -> Tower_Of_Hanoi_Solver
  *Description:* <br> A Tower of Hanoi solver implemented using stacks in C++, demonstrating recursive problem-solving and iterative moves between three pegs (stacks) to transfer disks from one peg to another while following the rules of the puzzle.

# 7. Queue
 ## -> Patient_Queue_Management_System
  *Description:* <br> Manages a queue of patients waiting to see a doctor, allowing operations such as adding patients to the queue, sending the next patient to the doctor, viewing the next patient in line, and displaying all patients currently in the waiting list.

 ## -> Theme_Park_Ticketing_System
  *Description:* <br> Manages multiple queues for selling tickets to different attractions in a theme park. Visitors can join a general ticket purchase queue, and then select from various attractions (Roller Coaster, Motion Ride, Round Wheel). Once tickets are sold, visitors are processed in separate queues for each attraction, indicating which attraction they are enjoying.

  ## -> Admission_Queue
   *Description:* <br> A program that manages admission queues for students based on their merit scores across three queues. Students can be added to any of the queues, and the program processes admissions by dequeueing students from the smallest non-empty queue based on length, with ties broken randomly.

# 9. Binary Search Tree (BST)
 ## -> Magical_Gem_Tree
  *Description:* <br> A magical forest-themed binary search tree (BST) implementation where each node represents a gem with its power. Allows insertion, search, deletion, and traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder) operations. The program simulates a game where the player collects gems (nodes) until their bag's magical power capacity is reached or exceeded.
